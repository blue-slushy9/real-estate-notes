# Notes courtesy of Heather C;

-Moratorium

-Crash coming soon?

-Try going to the house in person and making an offer; real estate agents will tell you not to;

-If a house is vacant, you will have to go through an agent;

-5% to 20% down payment is very good;

-Buy a house with cash, sellers like that;

-Building permit? Need it to sell/buy a house? Unless it's sold for cash;

-You can't apply for a mortgage for a house that's not permitted;

-Real estate agent charges 3% commission for inspection, etc.

-You'll need a lot of money for closing costs, i.e. all the labor involved; loan company, not the agent;

-If you use a lender other than the recommended lender, it will be much more complicated;

-Closing costs upfront vs. hidden;

-You can write off interest on your mortgage;
